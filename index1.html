            Mentorship is a powerful tool for guiding students through their academic and career journeys.
            With SLIETâ€™s focus on nurturing talent, a mentorship platform can create new opportunities by
            connecting SLIET faculty members with students who need career advice, academic support, or
            skill-building guidance.
            The goal of this challenge is to build a dedicated mentorship website for SLIET, where faculty
            members from our college act as mentors, offering their time to help students with academic
            and career-related queries. This platform will allow students to book one-on-one sessions with
            faculty mentors based on their availability, fostering smooth communication and personalized
            guidance within the SLIET community.
            This initiative will strengthen student-faculty interactions, providing continuous support and
            enhancing the personal and professional growth of students at SLIET.<p>
